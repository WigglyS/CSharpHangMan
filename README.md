# CSharpHangMan
Write a GUI program that's a lot like the game 'Hangman':      Create an array of 10 words (you decide the words).     Randomly select a word from the array.     Then prompt the user to guess a letter of the word     Then if the user's letter guesses matches any letter(s) in the word, then put the letter guessed into the proper indices of another array and display the contents at this point to the user.     Repeat till either all letters are guessed or the user misses 5 times.  Include all necessary error handling.
